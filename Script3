Ahhhh... it's over...
A
But the village is ruined...
R
Damn machines... what gives...
V
...Did you guys notice?
R
Notice wha'? I was too busy making scrap metal.
A
And thinks to me, you weren't turned into mincemeat.
R
No wonder why I felt unpleasent the whole time.
A
Huuuh?! Say that again why don't you!
Z
N-not again...
V
The villagers. Where were they?
Z
Now that you mention it...
A
Killed?
R
Death without corpses lyin' around? Firstr I've heard of it.
V
In other words, they were captured. By those... things.
R
Why would a buncha metal golems kidnap a whole village?
A
Even though we are oafs, you are really asking that question?
Haaa, its either for enslavement... or for their mana.
V
Neither of which are good situations.
We need to find the source of them quickly.
Z
Guys...
A
But where exactly? Not like they have left any clues.
Z
Hey, guys...
R
Nor could we understand a word they are saying either.
Z

R
Great... a lead right into the big scary forest...
A
Aw. Little darkness got you scared Rocky?
R
I'm about to show you something to be scared of!
V
Enough. Zephyr. You are sure this is the way?
Z
Y-yeah, I'm sure Volkan... these golems have a strange scent...
It's easy to... oh no...
R
I told ya, why it always gotta be a dank, scary forest!
pause
Z
I-I don't know if I'm cut out for this...
R
Cheer up lad. I never thought you could do it either.
A
Gotta admit, it surprising any of us got this far.
V
Well... either way it looks like we are on the right track.
Zephyr, keep us moving.
Z

A
I thought I wouldn't be surprised... but what is THAT!
R
I'm gonna need a lot more rock to deal with that...
Z
A-are we really going to do this...
We can always call the army...
V
And miss our chance to rid ourselves of our Oafish title?
No, this is our opportunity!
We either live and come out as heroes...
R
Or die an unmemorable death.
A
I suppose either way, we get glory somehow.
Z
You... you guys are insane...
R
And yet you stay with us.
V
Come on everyone, let's show ourselves in...
