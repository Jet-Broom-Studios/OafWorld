Ugh, how long is this going to take?
V
Quiet Aquarion, I'm sick of hearing your complaints all the time.
Z
Y-you know... it's not good to fight among-
R
Shu' et Zephyr, ya bein a pus!
A
Don't pick on the kid! He didn't choose to be like this!
Z
Uhm... you know I'm still here...
R
Ya takin 'ides now, lad? I kno' 'ere a 'ew eart' spikes can go.
Woul' giv' ya a 'eal 'wakening, woun' it?
A
I'm sure waterboarding would be in the cards too!
V
ALRIGHT!
Stop bickering, the two of you. Before I turn you both to cinders.
Z
Maybe... I should just suffocate everyone here...
Would be quick and painless...
V
Wait... Did you guys hear that?
Follow me!
R
Wha' in da...
pause
Z
What... what were those things...?
R
I'll tell you what they weren't! Where in the hell did metal golems appear from?
A
No caster in sight either...
V
This is... insane...
R
Whats insane is the lack of coordination between us! No wonder why they call us the Oafish Quartet!
No strategy! Just a bunch of gung-ho wizards!
Z
R-Rocky is right... we just barely made it through...
A
Wait... The village!

A

Z
Ahhhh... it's over...
A
But the village is ruined...
R
Damn machines... what gives...
V
...Did you guys notice?
R
Notice wha'? I was too busy making scrap metal.
A
And thinks to me, you weren't turned into mincemeat.
R
No wonder why I felt unpleasent the whole time.
A
Huuuh?! Say that again why don't you!
Z
N-not again...
V
The villagers. Where were they?
Z
Now that you mention it...
A
Killed?
R
Death without corpses lyin' around? Firstr I've heard of it.
V
In other words, they were captured. By those... things.
R
Why would a buncha metal golems kidnap a whole village?
A
Even though we are oafs, you are really asking that question?
Haaa, its either for enslavement... or for their mana.
V
Neither of which are good situations.
We need to find the source of them quickly.
Z
Guys...
A
But where exactly? Not like they have left any clues.
Z
Hey, guys...
R
Nor could we understand a word they are saying either.
Z
GUYS!
all

Z
Sorry... it's just that everyone was ignoring me...
And I think I have a lead...

R
Great... a lead right into the big scary forest...
A
Aw. Little darkness got you scared Rocky?
R
I'm about to show you something to be scared of!
V
Enough. Zephyr. You are sure this is the way?
Z
Y-yeah, I'm sure Volkan... these golems have a strange scent...
It's easy to... oh no...
R
I told ya, why it always gotta be a dank, scary forest!
pause
Z
I-I don't know if I'm cut out for this...
R
Cheer up lad. I never thought you could do it either.
A
Gotta admit, it surprising any of us got this far.
V
Well... either way it looks like we are on the right track.
Zephyr, keep us moving.
Z
Yes sir...
